# Why?

The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with GraphQL, Apollo Server/Client and Prisma

I wanted to be able to actually use this for something and my wife suggested pulling ingredients/directions from recipes and being able to tag/search them later

# Running

There is a docker-compose included, run `docker-compose up -d` to bring up all dependencies for the backend.

There is a separate frontend project [here](there)
